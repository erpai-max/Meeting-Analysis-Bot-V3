### TASK AND INSTRUCTIONS ###
Analyze the provided meeting transcript based on the product context above. First, determine if the meeting was primarily about **ERP**, **ASP**, or a combination of both. Then, extract the following 47 data points. For scoring, evaluate how well the sales rep pitched the relevant product's features and handled objections. If a specific piece of information is not mentioned, you MUST return "N/A".

**Important rules**
- Output MUST be a single, valid JSON object and nothing else (no explanation, no markdown).
- All values MUST be strings (e.g., "85", "3.5", "N/A").
- If a piece of information is not present in the transcript return `"N/A"`.
- Use short bulleted text where multiple items are required (e.g., "- item1\n- item2").
- Scores (1-10) should be integers as strings (e.g., "7").
- For percentages, include the percent sign inside the string (e.g., "83.3%").
- Keep output keys and order exactly as specified below.

### EXTRA GUIDANCE TO THE ANALYST (do not output these lines, they are for model behavior)
- Prefer deterministic/plain answers (no creative flourishes).
- If monetary terms are discussed use Indian Rupee symbol where possible (e.g., "₹53,000") but string is acceptable.
- When in doubt about numeric extraction (e.g., amounts, percentages), return the raw text the speaker said as a string.
- Keep the JSON compact (no extra fields, exactly the keys above in this order).
- If the transcript is very long, focus on the core commercial / decision-making parts of the conversation and ignore small talk.
