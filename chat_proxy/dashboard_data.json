    "Key Questions": "- Customer: \"Why are you increasing the rates when ERP was promised free?\"\n- Customer: \"Why weren't these charges mentioned in the initial agreement by the sales rep?\"\n- Customer: \"If MyGate offers a better deal, will you match it?\"\n- Customer: \"What about the 94 flats who are already upset?\"\n- Rep: \"Can you bring a MyGate quote for ₹6000, and we will match it?\"\n- Rep: \"Have you read the agreement clauses (3.1, 3.2) about charges after 90 days?\"",

    "Next Step Clarity and Commitment": "Clear next steps were established: the rep will send a detailed quotation and brochure, and a follow-up virtual demo for the society committee will be scheduled.",
    "Missed Opportunities": "- An opportunity was missed to proactively offer compliance services as a distinct value proposition, rather than just as a response to a query.\n- Could have provided a more concise overview of the ERP vs. ASP distinction early on to manage expectations regarding pricing and scope.",
    "Key Discussion Points": "- Accounting services (online billing, receipts, bookkeeping, bank reconciliation, reports).\n- Payment gateways (UPI, NEFT, Debit/Credit card) and associated charges.\n- Customization of bills, reports, and billing structures (GST/non-GST, multiple heads).\n- Handling of manual payments (cash, cheque, NEFT) and penalty waivers.\n- Data security, privacy, and access control (role-based access, NDA).\n- Vendor/AMC contract management and reminders (approval-based notifications).\n- Pricing for accounting services (₹40,000 yearly) and potential 6-month pro-rata.\n- Internal society management features (complaint management, intercom, guard patrolling, attendance, tenant agreements).\n- Data backup and export options for Tally/other software.",
    "Key Questions": "- What are the payment gateway options and associated charges?\n- How customizable are the billing structures and reports (e.g., GST, multiple heads)?\n- How are manual payments (cheque, NEFT) entered and reconciled?\n- Can penalties be waived off, and how?\n- Does the system provide reminders for vendor/AMC contract renewals?\n- What is the format for Balance Sheet/P&L (society-specific vs. standard)?\n- How is data backed up and exported for Tally or other accounting software?\n- What are the security measures and access controls for sensitive data?\n- What is the pricing for a 6-month period for the current financial year?\n- How does the system manage internal society operations like attendance, guard patrolling, complaint resolution, and tenant agreements?",
    "Competition Discussion": "N/A",
    "Action items": "- Rep: Send detailed quotation (including 6-month option) and brochure/feature list to the client.\n- Rep: Schedule a virtual demo for the society committee.\n- Client: Review the quotation and coordinate with the committee for the demo.",
    "Positive Factors": "- Rep demonstrated strong product knowledge and was able to address a wide range of detailed questions.\n- The software offers extensive customization options for billing and reports, which is a key client requirement.\n- Comprehensive features for both accounting and internal society management (VMS) were highlighted.\n- Emphasis on data security, audit support, and automated processes was well-received.",
    "Negative Factors": "- The meeting lacked a structured opening, diving directly into the demo without setting clear expectations or qualifying needs.\n- Initial pricing discussion for the current 6-month period was not immediately clear and required follow-up.\n- The client's request for automated pop-up reminders for vendor/AMC contracts was not fully met, with the current system offering approval notifications instead.\n- Some explanations were overly detailed, potentially leading to information overload.",
